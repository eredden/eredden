### Who are you?
As all men bound by the burden of Adam do, he began his day by **[adorning himself in garments to cover his 
naked flesh.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203%3A7&version=NIV)** Had he been a more sentimental man, he would have reflected on his morals rather than 
cleaning his molars. Perhaps twenty pages passed before the secular monk was obligated to begin his work. 
As a Virginian, he knew well that his ancestors would have never conquered this land without the mantra 
of **["He that will not work, shall not eat."](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41860)**
