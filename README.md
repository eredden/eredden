### Who are you?
The lamp towered over the corpse of the **[SECULAR MONK](https://firstthings.com/secular-monks/)**, a curved woman tapering off and bouncing back again 
from the light bulb to the flat bottom resting on the dark oak nightstand. The siren's call rings through 
the air. The corpse rises from his bed, unfurling the quilt which sought to preserve his sanctity. As his 
ears slowly deteriorated from the screech of the siren, he raised his hand and swiped it away for a day 
longer. He had won against the cousin of death for twenty years. 

As all men bound by the burden of Adam do, he began his day by **[adorning himself in garments to cover his 
naked flesh.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203%3A7&version=NIV)** Had he been a more sentimental man, he would have reflected on his morals rather than 
cleaning his molars. Perhaps twenty pages passed before the secular monk was obligated to begin his work. 
As a Virginian, he knew well that his ancestors would have never conquered this land without the mantra 
of **["He that will not work, shall not eat."](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41860)**

Unlike the monks of centuries ago, the secular monk works in solitude from a handed-down desk in his tomb.
The tools of his labor are his machine and mind. His yield is the satisfaction disseminated through two
monitors and an unimportant number which increments by one thousand seven hundred and thirty six every two
weeks. The secular monk is monastic because he unknowingly rejects the pleasantries of direct human
interaction. His work, education, hobbies, family, and friends are all **[abstracted from him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism_(social))** through the
TCP/IP stack.
